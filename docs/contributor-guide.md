# Contributor's guide

`GES-echem-suite` is an open source project and, as such, all the contributions are well accepted. If you want to contribute to the library, a simple guide on how to interface with the GitHub repository is provided in what follows.

## General development process

* If you are a first-time contributor:

    * Go to [https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-echem-suite](https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-echem-suite) and click the “fork” button to create your own copy of the project repository.

    * Clone the project to your local computer using the command (where `<YOUR_USERNAME>` represent your personal GitHub username): 
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/GES-echem-suite
        ```

    * Enter the reposiotry directory using the command:
        ```
        cd GES-echem-suite
        ```

    * Add the upstream repository using the command:
        ```
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-echem-suite.git
        ```

    * Now, when running the `git remote -v` command, the following reposiotries should be visible:
        * `upstream`, which refers to the GES-compchem repository
        * `origin`, which refers to your personal fork

* Developing your contributions:
    
    * Pull the latest changes from upstream:
        ```
        git checkout main
        git pull upstream main
        ```

    * Create a branch for the feature you want to work on. Since the branch name will appear in the merge message, use a sensible name.:
        ```
        git checkout -b the_name_of_the_branch
        ```

    * Commit locally as you progress (`git add` and `git commit`) Use a properly formatted commit message. If possible, write tests that fail before your change and pass afterward, run all the tests locally (use `tox` to verify the compatibility with all the supported version of python). Be sure to document any changed behavior in docstrings, keeping to the [NumPy docstring standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Sphinx annotation are very welcome. If brand new functionality are added to the package make sure to update the documentation as well.

* To submit your contribution:

    * Push your changes back to your fork on GitHub:
        ```
        git push origin the_name_of_the_branch
        ```
    * Follow the GitHub authentication process.

    * Go to GitHub. The new branch will show up with a green Pull Request button. Make sure the title and message are clear, concise, and self- explanatory. Then click the button to submit it.

    * Ask for review from the development team.
